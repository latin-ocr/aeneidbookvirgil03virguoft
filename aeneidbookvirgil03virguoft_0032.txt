So ends Virgil's story. Aeneas after ‘ohe war married Lavi-

HL—LIFE OF YIRGIL.

Publius Vergiliusss Maro was born B. C. ΤΟ an the little vil-
lage of Andes near Mantua, in the great, northern plain of
Ι tal y, watered by the river Padus, the modern Po. T he people
of this country were of Gallio descenb and not, close kinsmen of
the Romans or southern Italians, antl it} was nob till virgil
was twenty-one years of age that they were made full Roman
citizens Virgil⁷s father lived on a small farm, but was able
to give his son all the advantages of education to be obtained
in those days, perhaps seeing early in his boy some signs of
future greatness. Except that Virgil studied in Cremona and
Milan and at sixteen was sen‘o to Rome to the best: teachers·
there, we know practically nothing of his youth. This period
fell between the two great] civil wars of Rome, and from what
we know of Virgil's nature, the comparative peace of his boy-
hood and youth was more congenial than the civil wars that,
raged from his twenty-second to his fortieth year.
