IV. —THE AENEID OF VIRGIL.

The Aeneid belongs 10 1113 01355 οἱ poetry called Epic, that
15, itis 3 narrative poem, of an elevated character, describing
the exploits of heroes.

The following, condensed from Sellar‚ gives a general
account of Virgil's position and excellence as 3 poet.

There was before Virgil's time but one Roman Epic, the
Annals of Ennius, written two hundred years before, stirring
