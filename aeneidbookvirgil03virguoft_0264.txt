The attractive appearance of the book with its clear type, '⁷1
good paper and fine maps and illustrations prepares one for an
exceptionally well-editecl book, and he will not- be disappointed. ’
The editor’s books are nothing is: not practical. He tries
to keep before his mind at all times the peculiar needs‚ the J
limitecl equipment and the mental attitude of the average
student„ and throughout, in notes, introduction, and exer-aises '¹
writes for the student of Latin as he actually exists to-day ,j
in every High School in Ontario. There are few Canadian
Classical text-books of which it can be said with equa] truth
that they (lo not contain a line that every student who is to
use the book cannot understand ancl assimilate to his profit.
Two main purposes run through every portion of this
edition: the intelligent translation of Caesar's story into 3⁸·-

idiomatio English, and a gradual development of the power
to use the Latin language.
