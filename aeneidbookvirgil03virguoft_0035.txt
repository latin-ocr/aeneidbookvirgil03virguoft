in the world. Aeneas in ancient times and Augustus in
his own day are regarded as instruments in the hands of fate.
whichis a great inscrutable power working out 115 purposes
in the world through the agency of Rome.

With this idea οἳ universal empire 15 combined a reverence
for antiquity, for old 0115101115, for the religions faith of early
Italy, and an attachment to all places connected wit-h the 1115-
tory of the nation⁴

The Aeneid then, as an epic describing the great part Rome
played in the history of the world, as deterniined by the divine
deomes, is partly a national and partly a religious epic. It
has only a secondary interest as an epic of human 6011011, as

’ a portrayal of manners and character7 and it has always been

obJ'ected to the Aeneid that 115 central character 15 a failure —

‘that while Aeneas 15 blameless⁷ picus, and satient, he 15 1111111-

feresting‚ Weak, lacking in energy, that 116 15 a passive tool in
the hands of fate, not a great hero relying upon 1115 own
resources and Stirred by ordinary human passions. It may be
that· Virgil was determined in this largely by 1115 wem-mess of
the civil wars that had been raging 50 long. and by the dec-:ire
felt everywhere in his days for the restoration of peace, law,
order and piety. This desire was met by Augustus' policy,
and in this lay the security of Augustus' position.

Dido stands out as the 111051 life-like and interesting charac-
ter virgil has drawn, and even if 5116 (1065 represent to the
Roman the ha‘ted raoe of Carthaginians. and even it her deser-
tion by Aeneas calls forth no 111111 of c‹,·nde1nnation from the
poet, we cannot. but feel that virgil sympathetically entered
into the tragic nature of Dido's story.

Apart from character the main sources of human interest
developed in the Aeneid are: the nobility and (11151111)- of the
