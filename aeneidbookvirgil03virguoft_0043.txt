SIMILES IN BOOK 111. (from Sidywick).

“ The third book is remarkable as having only one simile.

1. 679, where 1116 poeb compares 1116 Cyclopes 1ο ‘lofty oaks
or conebearmg cypresses '. This comparison, slight as 1115,
illustratas Virgil's use of 1116 simile. Ordinarily wit-,h our poet
the thing compared, 1116 point of 1116 resemblance is obvious :
. ..Β111 1116 workmanship is eareful, and 1116 details of 1116

'picture are elaborated independently of the resemblance. The

simile is 1101 meant 10 illustrate3 11 15 simply used as a

ἠ variety, a relies 10 1116 story, an adornment. '³
