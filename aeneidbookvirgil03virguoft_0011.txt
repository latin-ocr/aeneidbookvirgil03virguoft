³⁴? IN a school edition of Virgil such as this. little claim can
ΞΖ be laid to originality of matter in the notes or introduction.
ᾗ , The only justification for adding one more to the long line
J of editions of Virgil ie the belief that in the arrangement
5⁴⁷- or presentation of matt-er the needs of a particular class of
g„ students can be more fully met than they are by any other
ζ ‘edition equally within their ronch. Hence. at every point.

the editor's first, considerat-ion has· been the nceds and tho

capacities of those pupils who are beginning to read Virgil in
‚— «ουτ High Schools; and this not: only in the conception of a
ξ· .beginner's difficulties, and the presentation of explanatory
’ ⁷ matter, bur, equally in the omission of much that is commonly
found in such editions, but which the editor considers it i<
impossible or undesirable for these students *ρο assimilate.

The first: and chief thing. and probably for most of these
ἱ ⁷ pupils the only thing7 is to understand clearly what Virgil
ξ . ” meant and pub ib into worthy English. But if this ie well done
⁷ ’- ¹ . (and if, is ‘ohe sole obJ'ect, of this book to contribube ‘co this

‚ ’ end), indirectly an interest·l in the poetry itself and a certain

” 7ἱθεεῌιῑιὲ forits beauty will be [ostered in the minds of many.
2 At this early stage, however, any-such germs of appreciation
Li: must arise unconsoiously3 it is ruinous to try bo force them
33ss ” into being.
