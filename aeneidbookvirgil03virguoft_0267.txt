THE W. J. GAGE C0.’s PUBLICATIONS.

CAESAR, BOOKS V. and VI.

English not the Latin constructions. By this arrangement
a pupil will see at a glauce the possible varieties of mean-
. ing one English expression may have, and can thus learn
readily to choose the correct Latin equivalent. Here again
caesai-’s range of constructions is kept constantly in view.

(C) List of the 300 words most commonly used by
Caesar. Every teacher will find more ways than one of
using this list.

(D) Exercises based on Caesar. Those based on Book V.
are for Primary classes⁷ those on Books V. and VI. for
Junior Leaving or Matriculation classes. In each case they
are absolutely sufficient to prepare candidates for examina-
tion in either Sight—work or Prose.

(α) The exercises in sight translation advance gradually
from simple sentences to connected narrative, and include
an adaptation of part of Book VI. (thus lightening the
pupil's work when he comes to that book) and of Caesar’s
narrative of the first invasion of Britain (so that the pupi]
can become acquainted With the whole of this episode).
These exercises always keep in view the vocabulary and
constructions the student has already met.

(b) The exercises in translation into Latin for Primary
students are single sentences, aiming not at the reproduc-
tion of sentences much as they occur in the text, but at new
combinations of phrases and constructions. all occurring in
the chapter but separately. The last seven of these exer-
cises form a revieW‚ conveniently grouped, of practically all
Caesar’s common constructions and usages.

(c) The exercises for Mati-iculation classes consist of nar-
rat-ive passages from Caesar and English writers such as
Parkman, Scott. Creasy‚ Miss Yonge and Fronde, for
which Caesar's vocabulary is sufficient.
