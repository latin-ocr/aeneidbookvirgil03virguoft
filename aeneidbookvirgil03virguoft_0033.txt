INTRODUCTION. xix

‘SVlJen in Ro. 41 peace for a time did come, the victorious
Octavian confiscated large tract-s of land in Italy and distri-
buted them among his soldiers. Virgil's farm (1115 father being
‘now dead) was thus seized on, but Vir-gil had become favorably
known bo Asinius Pollio, the governor of the district, and at
his suggestion Virgil went to Rome and appealed to Augustus
Restitution was made by order of Augustus, though Virgil did
not, regain 1115 farm, and soon We find Virgil living at Rome
under the patronage of the court. and on terms of intimacy
with the leading writers of the day. His first, volume of
poetry, the Eelogues, a collection of ten pastoral poemse com-
menoed before he came to Rome, was completed in B. C. 37, and
soon after he left Rome and for most of his remaining years
lived in Campania near Naples. From B. C. 37 to 30 he worked
at his Second great» poem² the Georgics, a series of four poenis

remaining eleven years of his life were devoted to his great epic
poem, the Aeneid. We are told that in B. C. 23 he read Books
IL, IV. and VI. to Augustus at the latter's request. In B. C.
19 the poet had completed his epic.¹ but: intended to devote
three years more to polishing and revising it. However.
while on a voyage to Greece and Asia that year5 he fell

” sick ab Athens and returned, dying jus-t as he reached

Italy.

In his last illness‚ dissatisfied with the condition of the

Aeneid, he asked his executors to burn it. but fortunately
· Augustus forbade their carrying out Virgil's last wish.

In person Virgil is said to have been tall and dark. of rustic
even awkward appearance. He was gentle, shy and reserved
in manner, and the purity of his lite gained him the name of
Parthenias, ‘the maiden. ² No authentic picture exists.

The tomb in which Virgil was buried near Naples long

remained an object of veneration‚ and Virgil himself in the

prophet.
