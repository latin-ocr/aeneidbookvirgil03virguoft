xxvi INTRODUCTION.

may be marked off3 then 'che quantity of syllables long or
short, by position, according to the preceding rules, can be
marked ; after which the first four feet, can, in alarge majority
of caseS, be settled beyond a doubt, without any reference 'to
the natural quantity of the vowels. Finally (and this is all-
jmpor‘oanb, if the student is ever to get, beyond this rule of
tsshumb and catch the rhythm of virgil), the line when scanned
should be read over according to the division made. ‘³²

CAESL'RA.

When a word ends within a foot. a caesara is said to occur,.
and in the dactylic hexamei‘en the caesura, or caesural pause
when i⁴tl coincides with a pause in the sense consuentes much
of the charm of the rhythm, the line falling into two unequal
parts· 7
The favorite caesural pause occurs in the third foofi, but
sometimes ib comes in the fourth foot, in which case there is
often another pause in ‘che second foma, the line thus being
divided into throe parts.

The pause is far more often after ‘ohe long syllable of a
dactylic foot than after the first shorb syllable. ἢ·
