FROM ΤΗΕ ΡΗΕΡΑΟΕ.

In a school edition os virgil such as this, little clalm can be laid to
originality of matter in the notes or introduc-tion. The 0111 justification
for adding one more to the long line of editions of Virgi is the belief 3.-
that 111 1110 arrangement or presentation ot matter the needs of a partic· ’
ular class of students can be more fully met thau they are by any other
edition equally within their reat-h. Hence, at every point, the editor's
first consideration has been the needs and the capacities of those pupils
who are beginning to read Virgil in our High Schools; and this not only
in the conception of a beginner‘s difficulties, and the presentation of
explanatory matter. but· equally in the omission of much that is com-
monly found in such ed1tions, but wluch the editor considers it is lm-
possible or undesirable for these students to assimilate.

The first and chief thhuz. and probably for most of these pupils the
only thing‚‚is to understand clearly what Virgil meant and put it into
worthy English. But if this is welldonc (and it is the soleobjeet of this
book to contribute to this end =. indirectly an interest in the poetry itself
and a certain feeling for its beauty will 110 fostered in the minds of many.
At this early stage. hoxyever, any such germs of appreciation must arise
unconsciously3 itis ruinous to try to force them into being.
