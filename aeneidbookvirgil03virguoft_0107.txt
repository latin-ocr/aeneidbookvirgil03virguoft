420-423. The originals of these two fabulous beings (suggest-
ed by the rocks, breakers and eddying current of the strait)
are to be found in Homer, Odyssey XII. 85-106. Homer’s
description of Charybdis is as follows : And on the other oliff
is a great fig-tree growing, and beneath it mighty Charybdis
sucks down black water, sor thrice a day she spouts it forth
and thrice a day she sucks it down in terrible wise. (And
again L 237.) As osten as she belched it forth, like acauldron
on a great fire she would seethe up through all her troubled
deeps, and overhead the spray fell on the tops of either cliff.
But oft as she gulped down the salt sea water, within 5110 was
all plain to see through her troubled deeps, and the rocks
around roared horribly and beneath the earth was manifest
swart with sand. [Buteher and Lang's version] Compare
also Schiller's ballad of the Diver‚ in Lytton's rendering.
High School Reader, p. 294.
