RHYTHM.

virgil uses in the Aeneid the lnetre known as Dactylic
Hexameter, that is a lin,² containing six dactyls‚ each dactyl
consisting of one long syllable followed by two short syllables,
Two irregularities however are to be noticed3 first, the last
foot has but two syllables (a long and a short⁷ or two long) ς
secondly, in any one, two, three 01· even fotu· of the first four
syllables a dactyl may be replaced by a spondae, that is a foot
consisting of two long syllables.

This metre is generally represented thus

——v
—s-aesd

Thus sixteen different an·a11ge1nents of the line are possible
'¹ (apart from the variation in the last soors), viz, one with the
first, four feet dactyss, four with one spondee in the line, six
with two spondees in the line, four with three spondees in the
line, and one wit-,h four sponslees in the first four feet. For
examples see the lines indicated on pa ge xxix

 

nmmos.

    
    
     

But, in a majority of the lines a further difficulty aris-es
Where the last syllable of a word ends in a vowel, or in m,
-,·‘ ¹. and the first syllable of the next word begins with a vowel or

’ h, these two syllables are elided or taken together and counted
’ as one. Such a case is called elision.³³‘· For example veras
inquit, counts as three syllables in scansion, so also zefferem
ut, divum humo, curru haeret.

Probably the best way for beginners to get the scansion of
Ἢ Virgil is,as follows: Mark first all cases of elisi0n3 then the
, two last. feet, which uniforml y consist of the last five syllableS‚

 

⁴* Elision is usually marked thus : *cm-(a j inquit or 2·e:·a‘“z'7zquit.
